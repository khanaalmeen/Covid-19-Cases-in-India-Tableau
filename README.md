## Project Name: Exploring India's COVID-19 Journey - A Case Study Analysis

🔎 "Decoding COVID-19: India's Case Study" is a comprehensive analysis project, where we delved into multiple datasets to gain insights into the COVID-19 situation in India. 🇮🇳🦠

💡 Analysed age-wise distribution, confirmed cases, recoveries, and daily decreases, along with state-wise data on cases, death and recovery status, hospital beds availability, testing data, and population distribution. 📈🏥

🎯Aim was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact in India, empowering decision-makers with valuable insights and effective strategies to combat COVID-19. 🤝💪

I have made a Tableau dashboard on Covid-19 Cases in India where I have used data from multiple data sources and have used Data Blending. 
 I have used 6 csv files and 1 shape map file.
 I have used measure names and dual axis to create multiple line chart, doughnut chart , stacked bar chart and horizontal bar chart.
 This dashboard gives us important insights into which states were most affected by covid, gender analysis, the doses administered etc..
