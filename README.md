# COVID-19 IN INDIA DASHBOARD WITH TABLEAU

### I have made a Tableau dashboard on Covid-19 Cases in India where I have used data from multiple data sources and have used Data Blending. 
### I have used 6 csv files and 1 shape map file.
### I have used measure names and dual axis to create multiple line chart, doughnut chart , stacked bar chart and horizontal bar chart.
### This dashboard gives us important insights into which states were most affected by covid, gender analysis, the doses administered etc..
